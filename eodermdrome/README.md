<blockquote>
An eodermdrome is a form of word play wherein a word (or phrase) is formed from a set of letters (or words) in such a way that it has a non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph">planar</a> spelling net.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Eodermdrome contains only the letters e, o, d, r and m. When plotted as a graph, the lettered vertices are sequentially connected by edges to spell a word. If the graph is non-planar, the word is an eodermdrome. The graph of eodermdrome is the non-planar graph K₅. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eodermdrome">via</a>]
</blockquote>

The word ‘supersaturates’ is likewise an eodermdrome.

<blockquote>
The graph of the complete word contains a subgraph which is a subdivision of the non-planar graph K₃,₃, and as such is itself non-planar. (ibid.)

Examples of eodermdromic phrases containing K₅ include [<a href="http://wordaligned.org/articles/oulipo-eodermdrome">via</a>]:

SHOES ON HENS
<br>SAMSON MOANS
<br>DRAB RED BEAD
<br>TEARS AT REST
<br>ÉTOILE, ORTIE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [star, nettle] &nbsp; → &nbsp; only works if we conflate L/R
<br>הלמדת מה דלתה &nbsp; &nbsp;[Hebrew: “Did you learn what her door is?”]

Nick Land's (2011: 636-38) diagrams of words from Deleuze & Guattari are likewise a form of spelling net.

### The Project:

Write a program to search a dictionary (or any other corpus) for eodermdromes.
<br>Optimally, the program should be able to display these graphically.

This project can be further extended to eodermdromic phrases or sentences. 
<br>Here, the vertices of the graph are not letters, but words.
<br>An example is: “March in students. March past in May. Past students may march.”
<br>It would be interesting to write a program to find eodermdromic phrases in any given corpus.
<br>Another idea is Oulipian short stories embodying interesting graph theoretic properties.

Eodermdromes can also be applied to non-phonetic writing such as Chinese or Japanese.
<br>Kennedy, Wexler, & Bloom (1980: 138) give an example from classical Chinese: 「知吾：唯足无，知唯无，吾足知。」
<br>Their translation: “That I know self denotes: just to fill nothing and to know nothing is to satisfy myself.”
<br>Note that here, the last 知 (zhī) is a <a href="http://ce.linedict.com/#/cnen/entry/34d96795a7384618acb90144b43d025e">通假字</a> (phonetic loan character) for 智 (zhì).
<br>Due to the sparse vocabulary of classical Chinese, other cases can likely be found ‘in the wild’.
<br>Tentative Chinese translation: 巡回文 (xúnhuíwén) — a portmanteau of 巡回 (cycle) and 回文 (palindrome).
